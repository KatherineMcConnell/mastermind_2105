# DTR: Define the Relationship


## What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

  * Marla - Interaction pattern; planning from scratch. Working from pairs; merging, creating branches. Github workflow.

  * Katherine - Making tests. Github workflow (meeting in-person with mentor planned in advance for Day1). Refactoring.

## What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

  * Marla - Divide & Conquer. Opposite of what project wants with driver/navigator.

  * Katherine - Teamwork type of person. Thinking driver/navigator with driver(me) stfu will offer me a greater opportunity to learn from Marla and Marlas style of thinking and solving problems.

## How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  * Marla - open. don't like things to be hidden. rather things be said sooner than later. good or bad. lots of communication; frequent & no judgement.

  * Katherine - lots of positivity. critical of self. defensive of self unfortunately. shut down when feeling defensive and distance. approach negative feedback with a postive statement, followed by negative statement fully explained & brainstormed multiple solutions and a positive ending.

## How would you describe your work style?

  * Marla - Drawing things out. Pseudocode. Pry.

  * Katherine - Drawing things out. Pseudocode. Pry. Print out. Pictures Uploads to share w/ partners.

## What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

  * Marla - Creative problem solver. See all pieces and see which way they can come together.

  * Katherine - Creative problem solver. Coding specific - learned alot of random stuff. And I do understand the game mastermind. I've done this project last mod.

## What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

  * Marla - Well: Deck of Cards from scratch - google, then thought it through self, alot of self, little bit of mentor. Poorly: Repeating too predictably, bug/stats, reach out earlier vs circles for hours.

  * Katherine - Well: pre-planned resource-persons to help. really great on googling. challenged myself to use logic that was new to me. Poorly: time-management; I should started earlier. I would like to see myself push myself a little harder to see things get done sooner, improve my independent logic and get revisions and refactoring practice.

## How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

  * Marla - giving space for each person to fully formulate idea and articulate

  * Katherine - Along with Marlas answer, being open and attentive while listening to the other articulate their idea and **prioritizing getting it working vs making it fancy** when choosing.

## How will we overcome obstacles?

  * Marla - communication. frequent communication. bringing things up sooner than later.

# Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine

## What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)

## When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?

## If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.

## Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?

## Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
